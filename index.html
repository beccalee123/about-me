    <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>

    <p>Nice to meet you! My name's Becca and I'm a Seattle-based JavaScript student and tech marketer. I'm a voracious
        learner who loves to translate my knowledge and intuition into thoughtful coding and marketing strategies. When
        I'm not working, you can find me cuddling cats, baking pies, eating ice cream, playing pinball, getting excited
        about neighborhood dogs, going on hikes, and watching pro wrestling (but you already know some of that from our
        Q & A fun!). </p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <p>I'm excited to be learning JavaScript and looking forward to having enough mastery to be able to help others
        learn. All in good time!</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>I'm currently in Code Fellows 201 working on my Certificate of Software Development.</li>
        <li>In 2016 I completed my Bachelor of Science in Marketing Management from WGU Washington.</li>
        <li>Back in another life, I completed my AAS in Apparel Design and Services in 2007.</li>
